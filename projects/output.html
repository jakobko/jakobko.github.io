                    Output is a physical publication issued twice a year, written by and for students at the Department of Informatics, University of Oslo. I participated in founding and producing the first and second issue of the student’s publication. Output is still being released, and this fall they released their sixth issue. 
                </p>

                <h4 class="mt-5">My role: Head editor and designer</h4>
                <p>I was responsible for producing and releasing the student’s publication. I had roles such as editor, designer, author and business contact.</p>
              
                <p>The target group was students. In order to make it more tempting to read something after a long day with heavy curriculum we wanted the design to appear as entertaining and easy to read. We also wanted to release it as a physical magazine, in order to make it easier to focus in an otherwise digital world.</p>
               
                <p>We started the design process by drawing inspiration from similar magazines. We wanted the design to focus on the text, with wide margins, spacious line heights and few visual distractions. By dividing the pages in a grid of four vertical sections the design was able to facilitate varied content while still maintaining a consistent expression.</p>
